Task 1: UI/UX - Web Design & Development
Objective: The goal is to create a simple, responsive blog page using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. You will need to display blog posts with a title, an image, a short description, and a "Read More" button.

Features to Implement:

Responsive Design: Ensure the blog page is responsive, meaning it should adapt to different screen sizes, especially mobile devices.
Blog Post Display: Each blog post will include:
A title (e.g., the name of the blog post),
An image (e.g., a thumbnail or featured image),
A short description (summarizing the post),
A "Read More" button (leading to the full post).
Dark Mode Toggle: This provides a better user experience by allowing users to switch between a light and dark theme.
Mobile-Friendliness: The design should be clean and easy to navigate on mobile devices by using a CSS framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) to ensure proper layouts.
Bonus (AJAX Comment Section): Implementing a comment section that uses AJAX allows users to submit comments without reloading the page. This ensures a smoother and faster experience, especially for larger blogs with many comments.

Task 2: Laravel Blade & Backend Development
Objective: The goal is to develop a basic User Management System using Laravel. This involves implementing user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and the ability for an admin to manage users.

Features to Implement:

Registration, Login, and Logout: Users must be able to register, log in, and log out from the system. Laravel’s built-in Auth system can be used for this purpose.
Role-Based Authentication (Admin & User): There should be different levels of access based on the user’s role:
Admin: Can create, update, and delete users.
User: Can log in and view their profile or dashboard.
Admin Dashboard: A specific dashboard view where the admin can manage users (create, update, delete).
Bonus (Livewire/Alpine.js): Livewire or Alpine.js can be used to add interactivity to the front end, making actions like form submissions or dynamic content updates smoother without reloading the page.
